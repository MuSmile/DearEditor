Exec In Window Usage
====================

modify build settings for desired language

for example for `Ruby` you need to modify file `Packages/Ruby/Ruby.sublime-build` and add line `"target": "exec_in_window"`

whole file should look like this

{
  "cmd": ["/Users/vhyza/.rvm/bin/rvm-auto-ruby", "$file"],
  "target": "exec_in_window",
  "selector": "source.ruby"
}

to disable output panel add `"show_panel_on_build": false` into your preferences (`Command+,`)

press `Command+B` to build file (unnamed files should have set proper syntax)
